fetch() global function

Q. What is fetch() global function ?

Ans. The global fetch() method starts the process of fetching a resource from the network, returning a promise that is fulfilled once the response is available.
The promise resolves to the Response object representing the response to your request.

Q. When we send an API request to a server and we get a response of 400, so where the value will go? Resolve or Reject?

Ans. A fetch() promise only rejects when the request fails, for example, because of a badly-formed request URL or a network error. 
A fetch() promise does not reject if the server responds with HTTP status codes that indicate errors (404, 504, etc.). 
Instead, a then() handler must check the Response.ok and/or Response.status properties.
The fetch() method is controlled by the connect-src directive of Content Security Policy rather than the directive of the resources it's retrieving.

Q. Explain the working of fetch ?

- JS Engine consists of Memory Heap and call stack
- Call stack consists of function call and gets executed sequentially. When there is a special type of function like async function(setInterval,setTimeOut),
then it registers the call in register call back then it inserted into queue known as Task queue
- The Task queue contains all the callbacks when they are ready for execution they get back into the stack
- But fetch() is a special function which is offered by Web API, is passed into special queue which is specifically vuild for fetch method.
This queue is also known as Priority Task queue.
- Priority Task Queue is preferred more than task queue for function execution.

- fetch() working is devided into two parts -
1. Other goes into reserving space
2. One part goes into handling api request


- In first part, it reserves spaces for two arrays. one is 'onFulfilled[]' and one is 'onRejection[]'
- onFulfilled is resolution part of Promise while the onRejection[] rejection part of Promise

In second part, we send the network request using third party. If we get request, the value goes into onFullfilled array.
If we were unable to send API request, the value goes to the onRejection[] array.
